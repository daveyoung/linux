Description:
		Switching efi runtime services to virtual mode requires
		that all efi memory ranges which has the runtime attribute
		bit set to be mapped to virtual addresses.

		The efi runtime services can only be switched to virtual
		mode once without rebooting. The kexec kernel must maintain
		the same physical to virtual address mappings as the first
		kernel. The mappings are exported to sysfs so userspace tools
		can reassemble them and pass them into the kexec kernel.

		/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/ is what kernel export for
		this purpose. The structure is as follows:

		subdirectories are named with the number of the memory range:

			/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/0
			/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/1
			/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/2
			/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/3
			...

		Each subdirectory contains five files:

		attribute : The attribute of the memory range.
		num_pages : The size of the memory range in page number.
		phys_addr : The start physical address of the memory range.
		type      : The type of the memory range.
		virt_addr : The start virtual address of the memory range.

		Above values are all hexadecimal number with the '0x' prefix.

		So, for example:

			/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/0/attribute
			/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/0/num_pages
			/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/0/phys_addr
			/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/0/type
			/sys/firmware/efi/runtime-map/0/virt_addr
                        ...
